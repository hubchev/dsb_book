	abstract = {The tremendous growth of social media and consumer-generated content on the Internet has inspired the development of the so-called big data analytics to understand and solve real-life problems. However, while a handful of studies have employed new data sources to tackle important research problems in hospitality, there has not been a systematic application of big data analytic techniques in these studies. This study aims to explore and demonstrate the utility of big data analytics to better understand important hospitality issues, namely the relationship between hotel guest experience and satisfaction. Speciﬁcally, this study applies a text analytical approach to a large quantity of consumer reviews extracted from Expedia.com to deconstruct hotel guest experience and examine its association with satisfaction ratings. The ﬁndings reveal several dimensions of guest experience that carried varying weights and, more importantly, have novel, meaningful semantic compositions. The association between guest experience and satisfaction appears strong, suggesting that these two domains of consumer behavior are inherently connected. This study reveals that big data analytics can generate new insights into variables that have been extensively studied in existing hospitality literature. In addition, implications for theory and practice as well as directions for future research are discussed.},

	abstract = {We may see competition among mobile providers to acquire new customers through campaign and advertisement war, especially on social media. The problem arises on how to measure the brand reputation of these providers based on people response on their services quality. This paper addresses this issue by measuring brand reputation based on customer satisfaction through customer's sentiment analysis from Twitter data. Sample model is built and extracted from 10.000 raw Twitter messages data from January to March 2015 of top three mobile providers in Indonesia. We compared several features extractions, algorithms, and the classification schemes. After data cleaning and data balancing, the sentiments are classified and compared using three different algorithms: Naïve Bayes, Support Vector Machine, and Decision Tree classifier method. We measure customer satisfaction on five products: 3G, 4G, Short Messaging, Voice and Internet services. This paper also discusses some correlated business insights in a telecommunication services industry. Based on the overall comparison of these five products, the {NBR} scores for {PT} {XL} Axiata Tbk, {PT} Telkomsel Tbk, and {PT} Indosat Tbk are 32.3\%, 19.0\%, and 10.9\% respectively.},

After examining the implications of the developing Web 2.0 phenomenon for travel businesses, this article focuses on {TripAdvisor} (www.tripadvisor.com), the largest online network of travel consumers. Using a sample of 100 hotels randomly selected from the London market, it shows that {TripAdvisor} displays detailed rich data that can be used in travel planning. Content analysis was used to identify common causes of satisfaction and dissatisfaction among reviewers. It was also discovered that few hotels are actively managing their reputation on the {TripAdvisor} site. Despite a facility to respond to criticism, few hotels used this option, calling into question how seriously hotels are managing user-generated content. Analyses also suggested that the belief that user-generated content sites have been compromised by false reviews is unfounded, with little evidence being found of reviews with characteristics that typify false postings.},

Design/methodology/approach – Using a very large data set of tweets (i.e. over 2.6m) about Company A’s food poisoning case (2015–2016). This case was selected because it is widely known, drew attention from various stakeholders and had many dynamics (e.g. multiple outbreaks, and across different locations). This study employed a supervised machine learning approach. Its sentiment polarity classification and relevance classification consisted of five steps: sampling, labeling, tokenization, augmentation of semantic representation, and the training of supervised classifiers for relevance and sentiment prediction.},

	abstract = {Individuals around the world in need of mental healthcare do not find adequate treatment because of lacking resources. Since the necessary support can often not be provided directly, many turn to the Internet for assistance, whereby mental health forums have evolved into an important medium for millions of users to share experiences. Information Systems research lacks empirical evidence to analyze how health forums influence users’ moods. This paper addresses the research gap by conducting sentiment analysis on a large dataset of user posts from three leading English-language forums. The goal of this study is to shed light on the mood effects of mental health forum participation, as well as to better understand user roles. The results of our exploratory study show that sentiment scores develop either positively or negatively depending on the condition. We additionally investigate and report on user forum roles.},

	abstract = {The inherent nature of social media content poses serious challenges to practical applications of sentiment analysis. We present {VADER}, a simple rule-based model for general sentiment analysis, and compare its effectiveness to eleven typical state-of-practice benchmarks including {LIWC}, {ANEW}, the General Inquirer, {SentiWordNet}, and machine learning oriented techniques relying on Naive Bayes, Maximum Entropy, and Support Vector Machine ({SVM}) algorithms. Using a combination of qualitative and quantitative methods, we first construct and empirically validate a goldstandard list of lexical features (along with their associated sentiment intensity measures) which are specifically attuned to sentiment in microblog-like contexts. We then combine these lexical features with consideration for five general rules that embody grammatical and syntactical conventions for expressing and emphasizing sentiment intensity. Interestingly, using our parsimonious rule-based model to assess the sentiment of tweets, we find that {VADER} outperforms individual human raters (F1 Classification Accuracy = 0.96 and 0.84, respectively), and generalizes more favorably across contexts than any of our benchmarks.},

Customer sentiment refers to the emotions expressed by customers through the text reviews. These sentiments can be positive, negative or neutral. The study explores customer sentiments and expresses them in terms of customer sentiment polarity. Our results ﬁnd consistency between customer ratings and actual customer feelings across hotels belonging to the two categories of premium and budget. Customer sentiment polarity explains signiﬁcant variation in customer ratings across both the hotel categories. With regard to managerial implications, the study ﬁnds that, when compared with premium hotels, managers of budget hotels should improve their staff performance and hotel services. The present study is not exhaustive and other factors like customer review length and review title sentiment can be analyzed for their effects on customer ratings.},
